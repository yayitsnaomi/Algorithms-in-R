Various algorithms, functions, plots for easy access and reuse 
1. Kmeans vs Gaussian Clustering
2. Kmeans custom functions (violin plot, elbow plot, and summary statistics) + end to end example 
3. Hierarchical Cluster & Distance Measures: Numerical Distances (Euclidean, Chevbychev, and City Block), Angular Distances (Cosine and Pearson Correlation), and Categorical Distances (Jaccard and Matching)
